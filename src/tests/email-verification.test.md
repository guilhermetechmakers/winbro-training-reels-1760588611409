# Email Verification System Test Plan

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Successful Email Verification
- **Given**: User clicks verification link with valid token
- **When**: Page loads with token parameter
- **Then**: 
  - Loading state shows spinner
  - API call is made to verify email
  - Success state shows green checkmark
  - "Continue to Dashboard" button appears
  - User can navigate to dashboard

### 2. Invalid Token
- **Given**: User clicks verification link with invalid token
- **When**: Page loads with invalid token
- **Then**:
  - Error state shows red X icon
  - "Invalid verification link" message appears
  - Resend verification form appears
  - User can enter email and resend

### 3. Expired Token
- **Given**: User clicks verification link with expired token
- **When**: Page loads with expired token
- **Then**:
  - Error state shows red X icon
  - "This verification link has expired" message appears
  - Resend verification form appears
  - User can request new verification email

### 4. Already Verified Email
- **Given**: User clicks verification link for already verified email
- **When**: Page loads with token for verified email
- **Then**:
  - Success state shows blue checkmark
  - "Already verified" message appears
  - "Go to Dashboard" button appears
  - No resend option shown

### 5. Resend Verification Email
- **Given**: User is on error state page
- **When**: User enters email and clicks "Resend Verification Email"
- **Then**:
  - API call is made to resend verification
  - Success toast appears
  - Button shows cooldown timer
  - User cannot resend until cooldown expires

### 6. Rate Limiting
- **Given**: User attempts to resend verification multiple times
- **When**: Rate limit is exceeded
- **Then**:
  - Error message shows rate limit exceeded
  - Resend button is disabled
  - Cooldown timer shows remaining time

### 7. Network Error
- **Given**: Network connection is poor
- **When**: API calls fail
- **Then**:
  - Error state shows appropriate message
  - User can retry the action
  - No infinite loading state

## UI/UX Tests
